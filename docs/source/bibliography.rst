Bibliography
============

This bibliography is not intended to be comprehensive, only to provide a quick introduction.

* `May and Leonard 1975 <https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/0129022>`_, "Nonlinear Aspects of Competition Between Three Species", *SIAM Journal on Applied Mathematics*, Vol. 29 No. 2, pp. 243-253. A predecessor of recent work on explicit graphs, this paper discusses non-transitive (rock-paper-scissors) competition in a well-mixed system.

* `Durrett and Levin 1994 <https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.1994.0028>`_, "Stochastic Spatial Models: A User's Guide to Ecological Applications", *Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B*, Vol. 343 No. 1305. This library is based on the models discussed in Section 6 of this survey.

* `Durrett and Levin 1996 <https://services.math.duke.edu/~rtd/reprints/paper90.pdf>`_, "Allelopathy in Spatially Distributed Populations", *Journal of Theoretical Biology*, Vol. 185, pp. 165-171. Models non-transitive competition between three strains of E. Coli bacteria on a lattice graph.

* `Reichenbach, Mobilia, and Frey 2007 <https://arxiv.org/abs/0709.0217v2>`_, "Mobility Promotes and Jeopardizes Biodiversity in Rock-Paper-Scissors Games", *Nature*, Vol. 448, pp. 1046-1049. The first example I am aware of of running May-Leonard symmetric non-transitive competition on a lattice graph, demonstrating the formation of spirals with the addition of a diffusion term, and demonstrating connections between the continuous-time, discrete-space system and the Complex Ginzburg-Landau Equation (CGLE).

* `Roman, Dasgupta, and Pleimling 2013 <https://www.arxiv.org/abs/1303.3139>`_, "Interplay Between Formation and Competition in Generalized May-Leonard Games." *Physical Review E*, Vol. 87 No. 3, March 2013. Introduces the :math:`(n, r)` notation for May-Leonard models and demonstrates the formation of multilevel domains, with superdomains containing subdomains of competing species.

* `Szabo and Sznaider 2004 <https://www.arxiv.org/abs/q-bio/0310017>`_, "Phase Transition and Selection in a Four-Species Cyclic Predator-Prey Model." \emph{Physical Review E}, Vol. 69, 2004. Demonstrates the formation of alliances between different species.

* `Szolnoki et al 2014 <https://arxiv.org/abs/1408.6828>`_, "Cyclic Dominance in Evolutionary Games: A Review", *Journal of the Royal Society Interface*, Vol. 11 No. 100. Recent survey paper on continuous-time graph models.
